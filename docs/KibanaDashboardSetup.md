# Kibana 7.17.x Dashboard Setup for E-commerce Analytics

This guide is tailored for Kibana and Elasticsearch version **7.17.15**.

## Prerequisites

- Elasticsearch and Kibana 7.17.x are installed and running
- The e-commerce backend application is running and sending data to Elasticsearch
- Access to the Kibana web interface

## Step-by-Step: Quick Setup Using Pre-Built Dashboards

Follow these steps to set up your analytics dashboards in Kibana 7.17.x:

### 1. Open Kibana

- Open Kibana in your web browser (default: http://localhost:5601)

### 2. Import Pre-Built Dashboards

- Go to **Stack Management > Saved Objects**
- Click **Import** (top right) and select the file: `docs/kibana-dashboards-export.ndjson`
- If prompted, choose to overwrite any existing objects to update dashboards.
- After import, you will see dashboards such as "E-commerce Event Overview", "E-commerce Product Analytics", "E-commerce Category Analytics", and "Product Performance Analytics" in the Dashboard section.

### 3. Create the Index Pattern

- Go to **Stack Management > Index Patterns**
- Click **Create index pattern**
- Enter the following:
  - Index patterns:
    - `user_events*` (for user event analytics)
    - `products` (for product performance analytics)

### 3.1 Initialize Product Data in Elasticsearch

Before creating the products index pattern:

1. Call the following endpoint to index all products:
   ```
   POST /api/product-search/index-all
   ```
   This will create the "products" index and populate it with all products from PostgreSQL.

   Note: You can call this endpoint again anytime to reindex all products with their latest analytics data.

2. Verify the index exists in Kibana:
   - Go to **Stack Management > Index Management**
   - You should see the "products" index listed
- Click **Next step**
- Select the **timestamp** field as the time filter field.
- Click **Create index pattern**

### 4. Open and Use the Dashboards

- Go to **Dashboard** in Kibana's sidebar.
- Open one of the imported dashboards (e.g., "E-commerce Event Overview").
- Set the time range in the top-right (e.g., "Last 15 minutes").
- Click the refresh icon and set an auto-refresh interval (e.g., 10 seconds) for real-time analytics.

### 5. Troubleshooting

- If you don't see any data:
  - Check that the index pattern is set up correctly and selected in the dashboard.
  - Verify that your application is sending data to Elasticsearch.
  - Make sure the time range includes recent data.
  - Ensure field names in the visualizations match your data.

### 6. Next Steps

- Explore the dashboards and visualizations.
- Set up alerts or create custom visualizations as needed.
- See the rest of this document for manual dashboard creation and advanced tips.
